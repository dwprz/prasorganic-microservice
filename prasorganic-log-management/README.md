# Prasorganic Log Management

Prasorganic Log Management is one of the components in the Prasorganic architecture Microservices that use the **EFK stack** (Elasticsearch, Filebeat, Kibana) for log management. **Elasticsearch** stores log data, **Filebeat** sends logs from the app.log file in each service, and **Kibana** is used for log data visualization.
